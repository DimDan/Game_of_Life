1. COMMON INFORMATION

The Game of Life is a cellular automaton witch was made by John Horton Conway in 1970.
The main rules are:
    1.Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbours becomes a live cell, as if by reproduction.
    2.Any live cell with more than three live neighbours dies, as if by overcrowding. Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbours dies, as if caused by under-population.
    3.Any live cell with two or three live neighbours lives on to the next generation.

2. INFORMATION ABOUT THIS PROJECT

The project was created by two students from Russia to gain some experience in programming. Its main goal is to make The Game of Life using Pascal. In the nearest future we plan to remake it using C++ and OpenGL libraries.
